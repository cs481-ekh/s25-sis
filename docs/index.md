# EIS Tracker

## Overview
The EIS Tracker is a student monitoring system for the Engineering Innovation Studio at Boise State.
There was a need to track student trends to get analytics for lab usage, especially across majors, as
well as see which students are in the lab and what training they have received in order to improve
lab safety. There was a previous system in place which had grown outdated, so this projects aims
to replace and improve upon it for the future.
